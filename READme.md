# **Figure 1 Lab Internship Emulator**  
## **Introduction**
**Aims**  
The [Figure 1 Lab (F1L) Internship Emulator](https://github.com/deanslee/FigureOneLab/blob/main/README.md) is an self-paced, bioinformatics/computational biology internship emulated aimed at sealing the cracks in the Bioinfo/CompBio talent pipeline by working with real data in real papers, created by [Dean Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanslee/). The project aims to give students and professionals skills to work on bioinfo/compbio problems in the biotech landscape.  

**Key Scientific Question**  
Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?  
- **Trastuzumab**: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.  
- **Bevacizumab**: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.  

## **Mini-Literature Review**  

<ins>**Cancer Cell Lines, Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and potential therapies**</ins>  

Cancer cell lines are used wideline in research, from testing potential therapies to better understanding a cancer's mechanisms. At the cellular level, cancer is an anomoly of cell division and regulation, and are often heterogenous. Traditional sequencing, or "bulk sequencing," gives us an average profile of cancer cells as a whole, but nuance is lost. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) provides more insightful data for cancer cells, capable of showing the genomic profile of individual cells via identifying RNA. This level of detail improves the research and creation of targeted therapies.
