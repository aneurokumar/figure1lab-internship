# **Figure 1 Lab Internship**  
## **Introduction**
**Aims**  
The [Figure 1 Lab (F1L) Internship Emulator](https://github.com/deanslee/FigureOneLab/blob/main/README.md) is an self-paced, bioinformatics/computational biology internship emulated aimed at sealing the cracks in the Bioinfo/CompBio talent pipeline by working with real data in real papers, created by [Dean Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanslee/). The project aims to give students and professionals skills to work on bioinfo/compbio problems in the biotech landscape.  

**Key Scientific Question**  
Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?  
- **Trastuzumab**: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.  
- **Bevacizumab**: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.  

## **Literature Review**
Single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) provides more insightful data for cancer cells, which can improve creation of targeted therapies. scRNA-seq is preferred because, unlike "bulk sequencing," it shows the current landscape of each individual cell by quantifying RNA. Tumors, groups of cancerous cells, are often hetereogenous, so scRNA-seq is very relevant in this application.
