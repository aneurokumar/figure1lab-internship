# **Figure 1 Lab Internship Emulator**  
## **Introduction**
**Aims**  
The [Figure 1 Lab (F1L) Internship Emulator](https://github.com/deanslee/FigureOneLab/blob/main/README.md) is an self-paced, bioinformatics/computational biology internship emulated aimed at sealing the cracks in the Bioinfo/CompBio talent pipeline by working with real data in real papers, created by [Dean Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanslee/). The project aims to give students and professionals skills to work on bioinfo/compbio problems in the biotech landscape.  

**Key Scientific Question (KSQ)**  
<ins>The original KSQ is as follows:</ins>  
Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?  
- **Trastuzumab**: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.  
- **Bevacizumab**: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

**Cancer and the use of cancer cell lines in research/therapies**  
At the cellular level, cancer is an anomoly of cell division, differentiation, and regulation. Cells have built in mechanisms to regulate their entire life cycle, and their failures result in seemingly endless proliferation, ignorance of surrounding cell signals, lack of self-induced death (apoptosis), and spreading to other healthy cells locally and throughout the body. [1] Cancer cells are often genetically heterogenous, rapid proliferation leading to mutations that lead to more rapid proliferation. A tumour can be composed of multiple cancerous cells with each cell having a different genetic makeup than its neighbors. Cancer drug treatments can be used to treat the abnormal mechanisms themselves.  

<ins>**Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and its potential and potential therapies**</ins>  

Traditional sequencing, or "bulk sequencing," gives us an average profile of cancer cells as a whole, but nuance is lost. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) provides more insightful data for cancer cells, capable of showing the genomic profile of individual cells via identifying RNA. This level of detail improves the research and creation of targeted therapies.
