# **Figure 1 Lab Internship Emulator**  
## **Introduction**
**Aims**  
The [Figure 1 Lab (F1L) Internship Emulator](https://github.com/deanslee/FigureOneLab/blob/main/README.md) is an self-paced, bioinformatics/computational biology internship emulated aimed at sealing the cracks in the Bioinfo/CompBio talent pipeline by working with real data in real papers, created by [Dean Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanslee/). The project aims to give students and professionals skills to work on bioinfo/compbio problems in the biotech landscape.  

**Key Scientific Question (KSQ)**  
<ins>The original KSQ is as follows:</ins>  
Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?  
- **Trastuzumab**: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.  
- **Bevacizumab**: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

## **Mini-Literature Review**

**Cancer and the use of cancer cell lines in research/therapies**  
At the cellular level, cancer is an anomoly of cell division, differentiation, and regulation. Cells have built in mechanisms to regulate their entire life cycle, and their failures result in seemingly endless proliferation, ignorance of surrounding cell signals, lack of self-induced death (apoptosis), and spreading to other healthy cells locally and throughout the body. [1] Cancer cells are often genetically heterogenous, rapid proliferation leading to mutations that lead to more rapid proliferation. A tumour can be composed of multiple cancerous cells with each cell having a different genetic makeup than its neighbors. Cancer drug treatments can be used to treat the abnormal mechanisms themselves.  

<ins>**Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and its potential and potential therapies**</ins>  
Traditional sequencing, or "bulk sequencing," gives us an average profile of cancer cells as a whole, but nuance is lost. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) provides the RNA sequencing inside individual cells, providing a live profile of the cells at the time of experiments. This data is particularly insightful for cancer cells, capable of showing a tumor's transciptomic profile of individual cells. This level of detail improves the research and creation of targeted therapies. 

<ins>**HER2, VGEF, their mechanisms, and FDA-approved drug therapies**</ins>  
**HER2** transmembrane protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, as well as an oncogene. HER2 is a member of a group of proteins called tyrosine kinase receptors, which have receptors on the cell surface and are important in cell signalling and cell regulation (division, movement, survival, etc.)[2]. HER2 overexpression is found in a subset of breast cancer, leading to hiigh proliferations and anti-cell death for diseased cells.

**VGEF** is a family of proteins called vascular endothelial growth factor, and is involved in regulating the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). When overexpressed, VGEF can cause many abnormalities in the vascular/lymphatic system, which can directly affect not only cell regulation (as mentioned for HER2) but also the rate of metastasis - the spread and invasion of cancer cells to other parts of the body.[4] Abnormal angiogenesis is a tumor's wildest dream, because tumors need blood vessels for nutrients (including oxygen) to growth. Blood vessels formed from overexpressed VGEF are also "structurally and functionally abnormal," which can sometimes lead to a hypoxic state for tumors, causing a higher production of VGEF. [5]
